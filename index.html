            <li>If you're having a birthday or just an easy Friday night at home, a chocolate pizza is exactly what you need. We went down the peanut butter route for the topping, but you can top it with whatever you like. Add some sliced strawberries, marshmallows, or just leave it at Nutella! Make our favorite homemade pizza dough or use your favorite store-bought brand for a super-simple dessert!</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450°. Sprinkle about half the sugar onto a clean surface. Place pizza dough on sugar and spread remaining sugar on top. Roll pizza dough out into an 11" circle. 
                Transfer dough to a large baking sheet and poke all over with a fork, then brush with melted butter. Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly. </li>
            <li>Spread Nutella all over crust, leaving a 1" border around the edge. Top with chopped Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Reese’s Pieces, and peanuts. Serve warm.</li>
